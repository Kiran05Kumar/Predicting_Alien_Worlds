"Predicting Alien Worlds: A Data Science Approach to Exoplanet Detection and 
Habitability" pioneers the exploration of exoplanets, employing sophisticated data science 
techniques to detect and categorize them. Analyzing data from missions like Kepler, the 
project seeks to understand diverse exoplanets, going beyond detection to assess 
habitability. This interdisciplinary initiative integrates insights from astronomy, physics, 
and data science, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge. Ultimately, it enhances 
understanding of exoplanetary systems and lays the groundwork for future research in the 
quest for extraterrestrial life, marking a significant step in unraveling the mysteries of 
distant worlds.
